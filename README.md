# simple-calculator
This is a simple calculator that does addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can input integers, negatives or decimal numbers.

I initially made this for my Web Programming class.

## future additions
At the moment, after inputting two numbers you **have** to press the equal button or else the math doesn't math correctly. One day I will fix this.
Aside from that I would like to:
- [ ] use bootstrap for responsive design
- [ ] implement more math functions (sqrt, log, pow, etc)
- [ ] show history
